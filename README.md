# Activity 3: Turtle graphics

In this activity you will fill in the code for an application that lets the user draw line graphics
by giving a "turtle" (who has a pen) instructions.

## Turtle commands

- <code>forward <em>distance</em></code>, <code>backward <em>distance</em></code>: moves the turtle forward or backward. (If the pen is down, a line is drawn.)
- <code>left <em>angle</em></code>, <code>right <em>angle</em></code>: turns the turtle left or right (the angle is in degrees).
- <code>pen up</code>, <code>pen down</code>: tells the turtle to lift its pen up away from the "paper" or put it down on the "paper".
- <code>color <em>color</em></code>: changes the color of the turtle's pen.
- <code>reset</code>: resets the turtle to its initial state (centered, facing up, black pen that's down).
- <code>clear</code>: clears the "paper" that the turtle has been drawing on.
- <code>repeat <em>count</em> { <em>command</em>; <em>command</em>; ... <em>command</em> }</code>: executes all the commands <em>count</em> times.
